# DevOps Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What would you do if an EC2 instance is getting slow?
- Check **CPU, Memory, and Disk Utilization** using CloudWatch metrics.
- Investigate **running processes** to identify bottlenecks using tools like `htop` or `top`.
- Ensure the instance type is sufficient for the workload; consider upgrading if necessary.
- Look for **network or I/O issues**.
- Verify the **application performance** logs.
- Restart the instance as a last resort.

---

## 2. If users can’t access an application hosted on EC2, what steps would you take?
- Verify the **instance health** in the AWS Console.
- Check **security group and network ACL rules** for proper port and IP configurations.
- Ensure the **application service** is running.
- Confirm the **DNS configuration** and connectivity.
- Investigate **application logs** for errors.
- Test the connection using tools like `curl` or `ping`.

---

## 3. What’s the difference between a Load Balancer and a Reverse Proxy?
- **Load Balancer** distributes traffic across multiple servers for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Reverse Proxy** acts as an intermediary server to forward client requests to backend servers, often providing caching, SSL termination, and additional security.

---

## 4. How would you write a Terraform script to create an EC2 instance and run a script on every reboot?
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOT
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Script runs on every reboot" >> /var/log/reboot.log
              EOT

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

## 5. What is a Backend in Terraform, and why is it used?
- **Backend** defines where Terraform stores its state data (e.g., local, S3, or Consul).
- It is used to enable state sharing, locking, and remote operations.

---

## 6. What is the Docker lifecycle?
1. Create
2. Start
3. Stop
4. Restart
5. Pause
6. Unpause
7. Remove

---

## 7. What are the key Docker components?
- **Docker Engine**: The runtime environment.
- **Docker Images**: Templates for containers.
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of images.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining multi-container applications.
- **Docker Hub**: Registry for sharing images.

---

## 8. What’s the difference between a Docker Image and a Docker Container?
- **Docker Image**: A read-only template with application code and dependencies.
- **Docker Container**: A running instance of a Docker image.

---

## 9. What should you do before creating a Docker container?
- Ensure the Docker image is properly built.
- Verify dependencies are included.
- Confirm the application is tested locally.

---

## 10. What is Docker Compose, and how do you use it?
- **Docker Compose**: A tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- Use a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services and run `docker-compose up`.

---

## 11. What steps would you take if you see an "unhealthy" status in an ELB?
- Check **target group health checks**.
- Ensure instances are running and reachable.
- Verify **security group rules**.
- Look at **application logs** for errors.

---

## 12. How do you optimize Docker images for better performance?
- Use **multi-stage builds**.
- Minimize the number of layers.
- Avoid including unnecessary files.
- Use a minimal base image like `alpine`.

---

## 13. How would you secure a Docker container?
- Use **non-root users**.
- Limit container capabilities.
- Implement network policies.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities.
- Use signed images.

---

## 14. What is Jenkins scaling, and how do you achieve it?
- Scaling Jenkins involves adding worker nodes to handle more builds.
- Use Jenkins distributed builds by configuring a master-slave architecture.

---

## 15. What is the role of the Master and Node in Jenkins?
- **Master**: Orchestrates builds and provides the UI.
- **Node**: Executes build tasks.

---

## 16. What is a Sidecar container, and when would you use it?
- A **Sidecar container** runs alongside a main application container, providing auxiliary services like logging, monitoring, or proxying.

---

## 17. What is the difference between ConfigMap and Secrets in Kubernetes?
- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive configuration data.
- **Secrets**: Stores sensitive data like passwords or keys.

---

## 18. What is the default deployment in Kubernetes?
- **Deployment**: Manages stateless applications and ensures updates with rollbacks.

---

## 19. What are Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes?
- **Taints**: Restrict which nodes can schedule pods.
- **Tolerations**: Allow pods to override taints.

---

## 20. What is a Static Pod in Kubernetes, and how is it different from a regular pod?
- **Static Pod**: Managed directly by the kubelet, not by the API server.
- Regular pods are managed by the API server.

---

## 21. How do you check pod logs and attach Prometheus for monitoring?
- Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
- Attach Prometheus by deploying Prometheus and configuring it to scrape metrics.

---

## 22. How would you define a ConfigMap and Secrets in Kubernetes?
- ConfigMap:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-config

data:
  key: value
```
- Secrets:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-secret

data:
  key: c2VjcmV0
```

---

## 23. What is the default scaling in Kubernetes, and how does it work?
- Kubernetes uses the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** to scale pods based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.

---

## 24. What is RBAC in Kubernetes, and why is it important?
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** restricts resource access based on roles.
- It improves security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.

---

## 25. What’s the difference between ClusterRole and Role in RBAC?
- **ClusterRole**: Grants permissions across the cluster.
- **Role**: Grants permissions within a specific namespace.
