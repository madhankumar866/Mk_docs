# Python skeleton 
!!! Notes
       Is a basic structure of a Python program that can be used as a starting point for writing new code. It provides a basic framework for organizing the code and helps to ensure that the program has the necessary elements, such as import statements, variable and function definitions, and basic control structures.

####  A Python skeleton typically includes:
!!! Notes
        Import statements for any required libraries or modules.
        Function definitions for any functions that will be used in the program.
        Variable definitions for any variables that will be used in the program.
        Basic control structures, such as loops and conditional statements.
        Placeholder comments or print statements to indicate where new code should be added.
        Here's an example of a Python skeleton for a program that calculates the sum of two numbers:

```
Import statements
Function definitions
Variable definitions

Main program
   if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Add your code here
```

!!! Note 
        The skeleton provides a basic structure for the program, and you can add your own code within the placeholders to create a complete program. The skeleton can be customized to meet the specific needs of your program, such as adding additional import statements, functions, or variables, as needed.
