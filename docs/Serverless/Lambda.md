##  Systems Manager Parameter Store.

  API key must be stored securely with audited access to the Lambda function only.


  Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values. You can store values as plaintext or encrypted data. You can reference Systems Manager parameters in your scripts, commands, Systems Manager documents, and configuration and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.
